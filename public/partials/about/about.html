		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Welcome to the Swiss Army YouTube Searcher! (The name is subject to change, as it has changed once already. Fair warning..) The goal of this app is to allow the user to gain more freedom in searching for YouTube videos. It was originally created with all of the hardcore YouTube junkies out there in mind (myself included), but of course can be enjoyed and used by anybody.</p>
		<p>In the future there may be more search options available, so stay tuned, and in the meantime, enjoy!</p>

		<h2>Guide</h2>
		<p>You can simply do a basic video search via the default search bar. Clicking "Toggle Advanced" brings out the advanced search parameters.</p>
		<p>Once you have results on the page, you can click "Show/Hide Videos" to toggle the view of these results. Utilizing this and "Show/Hide Channels" can be useful if you need to toggle between video and channel results. Channel search will be explained shortly.</p>
		<p>Currently, you can search by location, result order, safe search settings, date range (from, to), and also by a particular channel filter.</p>
		<p>The location parameter uses Google Maps to allow the user to select a portion of the map using an adjustable circular selector. <span class="bold emph">Due to the limits of the API, radii of selections cannot exceed 1000 kilometers.</span> You can clear the selection by clicking the "Clear Selection" button. The coordinates of the center of the circle and its radius are displayed to the left and right of the "Clear Selection" button, respectively. </p>
		<p>If you want to search the contents of a specific channel, here's what you do:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>First, search for a channel in the "Search Channel" input box</li>
			<li>Assuming you get back results, select whichever channel you'd like by clicking on its image. You should then see the filter applied represented by an icon below the search bar.</li>
			<li>You will now only get results from that particular channel back. Clicking on another channel will reset the filter. You can remove the filter by clicking the "Clear Filter" button.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The translate feature is the newest addition to the app. You can set a language, and before search execution, the API will translate the keywords (you will also see it in the search bar, allowing you to make tweaks if you wanted to get different results).</p>
		<p>You can also click the "Save Search" button to save and store the current search parameters as an item in your local storage. You can find all of your saved past searches in the "Personal" view. In the "Saved Searches" area of this view, clicking the "Grab!" button will activate the respective saved search and fill the current parameters. Note that this doesn't immediately initialize the search, so you can tweak any of the parameters as you wish before making your search.</p>

	<h2>Known Bugs/Issues</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Map sometimes doesn't expand as it should. Simply refreshing the page should solve this.</li>
		<li>Sometimes issues occur when fetching saved searches/videos, and you may not see any of your saved content. Simply refreshing the page should solve this.</li>
		<li>This app works best in Google Chrome. I continue to add fixes to any cross-browser issues I may come across.</li>
